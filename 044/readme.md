# API Gateway with cognito token authorization. 


Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed serverless offering from AWS that makes it easy for developers to develop and maintain APIs. It acts as an entry point to your application API and abstracts all the complex tasks and protocols such as authentication/authorization, load balancing, rate limiting, CORS, etc., and allows you to focus more on the business logic. You can use API Gateway to build REST APIs and WebSocket APIs.
